The database design for this app doesn't need to be very complicated.

Lists of tickets are stored in 'tables'. Columns are:
_id INTEGER_PRIMARY KEY
name TEXT

These columns are stored in DatabaseHelper.MetaTable.

Individual tickets are stored in 'tickets'. Columns are:

_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY
text TEXT
first_scan INTEGER (Java gives times as long, no need to translate to DATETIME)
scan_count INTEGER
table_id INTEGER FOREIGN KEY references tables(_ID)

These columns are stored in DatabaseHelper.TicketTable.
