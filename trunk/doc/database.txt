The database design for this app doesn't need to be very complicated.  Each
list of tickets will be its own table, referenced by name. Columns will be:

_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY
text TEXT
first_scan INTEGER (Java gives times as long, no need to translate to DATETIME)
scan_count INTEGER

These columns are stored in Constants.TicketTable.
